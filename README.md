# offer-example
An example project based around a 'offer' demonstrating Spring Boot and current best practices.

Technologies used:
* Spring Boot
* H2 database
* PlantUML for diagrams.  Diagrams generated by gravizo.com.

# How to get started
Clone this repository and then run:

`mvn clean install`

# Modules

## Module overview
This project has a number of modules, which albeit don't contain much code, but are there to show how a complex system could be split up:

* Database - contains schema DDL and DML to populate tables with initial data.
    * Database creation and data population performed by running standard Maven clean install, there is a simple Spring Boot application and this effectively bootstraps the database creation using some POC (Proof Of Concept) type features that Spring Boot has (schema.sql and data.sql).
* Domain - domain object(s).
* Persistence - Persistence layer for domain objects.
* Service - Service layer interacting with persistence and controlling transactions.
* Web - REST controllers.

## Alternative module structures
The project could have been split into other module structures, namely something like the below:

### Alternative module structure 1
* Core
* Web

### Alternative module structure 2
* Single module - i.e. like Spring Boot starter.


## Use cases
![Alt text](https://g.gravizo.com/source/svg?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halljon/offer-example/master/docs/use-case-overview.plantuml)
Note: the below is the REST API exposed, see Things to do - better documentation to be created).

# Basic REST API
Please note: this is basic API, see things to do where there is already a ticket raised to document properly)

## Create offer
```
URL: /v1/offers/{merchantIdentifier}
Method: POST  <-- Note: this is POST instead of PUT because it is not idempotent - the Offer Identifier is generated by the server-side.
Request body: Offer JSON
Response code: 200 for OK, 400 for bad request - invalid offer.
Response body: Offer Identifier of newly created Offer
```

## Cancel offer
```
URL: /v1/offers/{merchantIdentifier}/{offerIdentifier}  
Method: DELETE  
Response code: Return 200 for OK, 404 for Offer not found
```

## Find active offers
```
URL: /v1/offers/{merchantIdentifier}
Method: GET
Response code: Return 200 for OK
Response body: active Offers JSON
```

## Find active offer
```
URL: /v1/offers/{merchantIdentifier}/{offerIdentifier}
Method: GET
Response code: Return 200 for OK, 404 for Offer not found
Response body: active Offer
```

# Things to do 
* [Exception handling configured for controllers to give a 500 whenever anything goes wrong](https://github.com/halljon/offer-example/issues/30) 
* Change timestamp to local date time.
* [Document REST API](https://github.com/halljon/offer-example/issues/26)
* Add caching of currencies, so that currency code can be quickly checked, rather than simply relying on the database foreign key constraint.
* Tidy up application.properties, as currently in a few modules.
* Look at the //TODO: comments, add issues or remove.
* Auditing and accountability columns omitted from schema.
* Request correlation id.

# Points to note
* Application context slicing by virtue of repository module.
* Application context slicing using Spring Boot's support.
* DateTimeService created so more control over dates could be added - i.e. to control what date/time it is beyond simply getting current system time.
* Please note: be careful with H2 local file locking - i.e. make sure it isn't locked by another process or a locking exception will be raised.

# Assumptions
Timezones have been ignored.
